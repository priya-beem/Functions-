        "\n",
        "Ans-In Python, both functions and methods are callable objects that perform a specific task, but they differ primarily in how they are defined and used. Here's the breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        "Function\n",
        "A function is a block of code that is designed to perform a particular task. It can be defined at any level in your program and is independent of any class or object.\n",
        "\n",
        "You define a function using the def keyword, and it can be called anywhere in the program, given it's in the scope.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of a function:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy\n",
        "def greet(name):\n",
        "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "print(greet(\"Alice\"))  # Calling the function\n",
        "Method\n",
        "A method is similar to a function, but it is associated with an object (or class). It is essentially a function that is part of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Methods are always called on an instance of the class (or the class itself for class methods). They take at least one argument: self, which refers to the instance of the class (or cls for class methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of a method inside a class:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy\n",
        "class Person:\n",

        "person = Person(\"Alice\")  # Creating an object of the class Person\n",
        "print(person.greet())  # Calling the method on the object\n",
        "Key Differences:\n",
        "Context:\n",
        "\n",
        "A function is independent and can be defined and called globally.\n",
        "A method is always tied to an object or class and is called on that object.\n",
        "Calling:\n",
        "\n",
        "A function is called by its name, like function_name().\n",
        "A method is called on an instance or class, like object.method() or Class.method() for class methods.\n",
        "Binding:\n",
        "\n",
        "A function doesn't automatically receive an instance as an argument.\n",
        "A method automatically receives the instance (via self for instance methods) or the class (via cls for class methods)."

        "Qn2) Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-In Python, function arguments and parameters are essential concepts related to how values are passed into and used inside a function. Though these terms are often used interchangeably, they have slightly different meanings in the context of a function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Parameters\n",
        "Parameters are the names used in a function definition to represent the values that will be passed to the function when it's called.\n",
        "They act as placeholders for the arguments that will be passed into the function.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy\n",
        "def greet(name, age):  # 'name' and 'age' are parameters\n",
        "    print(f\"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\")\n",
        "In this example:\n",
        "\n",
        "name and age are parameters of the greet function.\n",
        "Arguments\n",
        "Arguments are the actual values you pass into a function when calling it. These values are assigned to the corresponding parameters in the function definition.\n",
        "Arguments are provided in the function call, and they replace the parameters when the function executes.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Alice\" and 30 are the arguments passed to the function greet.\n",
        "These arguments are assigned to the parameters name and age, respectively.\n",
        "Types of Arguments\n",
        "Python allows different types of arguments to be passed to functions. Here are the common ones:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Positional Arguments\n",
        "These are the most basic type of arguments. The values you pass are assigned to parameters based on their position in the function call.\n",

        "python\n",

        "\n",
        "result = add(3, 5)  # 3 is assigned to 'a', and 5 is assigned to 'b'\n",
        "2. Keyword Arguments\n",
        "Keyword arguments allow you to specify which parameter an argument should be assigned to by using the parameter name in the function call. This can make the function call more readable and allows for flexibility in the order of arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy\n",

        "\n",
        "greet(age=30, name=\"Alice\")  # Arguments are passed with keywords\n",
        "3. Default Arguments\n",
        "Default arguments allow you to set a default value for a parameter. If no argument is provided for that parameter when calling the function, the default value is used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
